## TORSN00P

#### A comprehensive reconnaissance utility for surface-level analysis of .onion hidden services

designed for ethical research, intelligence gathering, or cybersecurity auditing within the Tor network. Tailored specifically for hidden services, this script performs automated metadata collection, fingerprinting of technologies, content hashing, and structural breakdown of onion-based websites â€” all via a secure SOCKS5 proxy over Tor.

**Requirements:**

- Tor must be running and accessible via localhost:9150

- Python 3.6+

- Dependencies: requests, bs4, Pillow
